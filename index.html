My opinion on hot cheetos: I feel when we talk about spicy snacks hot cheetos is still the spicy snack that crosses everyone's mind just because of how popular hot cheetos has became throughout the years.
Yes there has been arguments that takis are taking over hot cheetos but research shows that they still got a lot of catching up to do, there are still a lot more hot cheetos being sold than takis all over the world.
